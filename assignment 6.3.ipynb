        "\n",
        "*   **Nested `if-elif-else`:** The first function uses an initial `if-else` block to handle the `Invalid Age` case, and then places a separate `if-elif-else` structure *inside* the `else` block. This nesting can be useful for grouping related conditions or when the initial check completely separates a large branch of logic. However, for a series of mutually exclusive conditions like age ranges, it can sometimes make the code appear slightly more complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Simplified `if-elif-else`:** The second function uses a single, flat `if-elif-else` chain. The conditions are evaluated sequentially. Once a condition is met, the corresponding block is executed, and the rest of the `elif` and `else` blocks are skipped. This structure is often preferred for its linear flow and better readability when handling a series of distinct, ordered conditions. The `elif age <= 12` implicitly means `age >= 0` (because `age < 0` was caught by the initial `if`), `elif age <= 17` implicitly means `age > 12`, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this specific age classification scenario, the **simplified `if-elif-else`** chain is generally considered more Pythonic and easier to read because the conditions are naturally ordered, and the lack of nesting reduces visual complexity."
