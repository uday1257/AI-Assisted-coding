This means that the same list object `[]` is used every time `add_item` is called without explicitly passing a value for `items`.\n",

        "So, when `add_item(1)` was called, `1` was appended to the *shared* list. Then, when `add_item(2)` was called, `2` was also appended to the *same shared list*, leading to `[1, 2]` as the output, which is usually not the intended behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Fix:**\n",

If `items` is indeed `None` (meaning no list was explicitly passed by the caller), a *new, empty list* is created for `items` **each time the function is called**.\n",
        "\n",

Most Python style guides (like PEP 8) recommend using 4 spaces for each level of indentation. The corrected code snippet ensures that all lines within the `func_fixed` function body are indented consistently with spaces."
